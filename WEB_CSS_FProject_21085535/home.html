                    <p>Did you know that seven out of the eight planets in our solar system are named after either Greek or Roman deities and you might think we humans are surely living on of the said planets but no. Instead we are living on the one exception called Earth which is only named so because we are standing on it. However, that does not mean we should devalue or neglect its importance to its inhabitants. In fact, Earth is one of the very few habitable planets that are not millions and millions of light-years away. By housing various other species ranging from animals to insects and plants, Earth is not only our home alone but theirs as well. The reason why Earth is brimming with life while the other surrounding planets in this solar system are not is because Earth provides an environment that is rich with resources for its inhabitants to strive and grow. These natural resources are the core contributing factors that help make us human the evolved and civilized species we are today. Most important of all, the elements that allow all life to start or continue living such as oxygen and water too originated from our environment. Therefore by destroying the environment that Earth has graciously provided to us, we are inevitably causing ours and others species' extinction.</p>

                    <h2 class="threatsHead">What are the THREATS?</h2>
                    <p>Our environment is incredibly susceptible to all sorts of threats even before industrialization became the trend for improving a country's economy. Even so, a great deal of the environment's threats stem from human activities, specifically those that involve monetizing natural resources. Although there are laws placed by the governments to mitigate said harm to the environment, the majority of the public are still ignorant of the negative effects that these activities have on our environment or are just too selfish to care, hence the state of our environment in recent years only continues to grow more dire. Here are some human activities that destroy the environment. Click the pictures for more details.</p>

                    <h2 class="threatsInfoHead">Deforestation</h2>
                    <p>Historically deforestation has caused all kinds of negative effects, namely climate change since trees help modulate the planet's temperature, habitat loss for flora and fauna, soil erosion and droughts due to lack of greenery to regulate water cycle.</p>

                <div class="threatsInfo" id="OE">
                    <h2 class="threatsInfoHead">Overexploitation</h2>
                    <p>Overexploitation of natural resources will harm nature's biodiversity as harvesting these goods often requires the destruction of the environment while consequently creating issues such as pollution, climate and depletion of nonrenewable resources.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="threatsInfo" id="OP">
                    <h2 class="threatsInfoHead">Overpopulation</h2>
                    <p>To satisfy the needs of an increasing population, our environment's natural resources are essential and are constantly exhausted thus overpopulation is directly associated with activities that destroy our environment like the mentioned deforestation and overexploitation.</p>

                <div class="threatsInfo" id="air">
                    <h2 class="threatsInfoHead">Air Pollution</h2>
                    <p>Major industries and many aspects of our day-to-day life release various type of air pollutants. These air pollutants are correlated with existing problems like acid rain, climate change and eutrophication (an phenomena that destroys aquatic life by depriving them of nutrients).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="threatsInfo" id="water">
                    <h2 class="threatsInfoHead">Water Pollution</h2>
                    <p>Irresponsible waste handling by both locals and corporations, primarily their waste dumping habits are the cause of water pollution. The aquatic life is jeopardized when these foreign substances are introduced into their habitat and deals irreversible damage to their food chain.</p>

                <div class="threatsInfo" id="land">
                    <h2 class="threatsInfoHead">Land Pollution</h2>
                    <p>Unethical or poor waste management along with exploitation of minerals and terrible agriculture practices by us humans have not only drained our land dry but also polluted it. As a result, nature's ecosystems are disturbed as a lot of life lives off nutrients from the land itself.</p>

                    <p>Routinely check for leaky paips, take shower instead of bath, switching to LED light bulbs and various other similar method will not only cut down your cost but also ensure there are more resources for our future.</p>

                    <h2 class="solutionsInfoHead">Plant</h2>
                    <p>Plants especially trees, absorbs carbon dioxides as their food. This effect ultimately reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere which will then slow down climate change. So when possible, plant whatever is manageable for you.</p>

                <div class="solutionsInfo" id="recycle">
                    <h2 class="solutionsInfoHead">Recycle</h2>
                    <p>Simply sort your trash according to their materials. Normally, it is divided into groups like plastic, paper and glass while the rest remains as non-recyclable waste then just leave them in their appropriate bins and your work here is done.</p>

                <div class="solutionsInfo" id="compost">
                    <h2 class="solutionsInfoHead">Compost</h2>
                    <p>Instead of throwing our your leftover foods or other organic waste, consider utilising them as fertilisers for your plants and soil. Doing so will give these waste of ours a more meaningful end aside from being another pile of landfills.</p>

                    <h2 class="solutionsInfoHead">Support Eco-Friendly Product</h2>
                    <p>Anything that has a reusable alternative should be avoided as these single use items just create more unnecessary waste at the end of the day. A simple example would be the plastic bag. Why keep getting charged for them when recycle bags exist.</p>

                <div class="solutionsInfo" id="food">
                    <h2 class="solutionsInfoHead">Buy Sustainable Food Product</h2>
                    <p>Meat related products require a large amount of resources to cultivate and their production releases an enormous methane that contributes toward climate change. Try including a few meat-free days in your week or cut down your meat consumption if it is possible.</p>
